## Abstract

The brain signals have both a linear and a nonlinear distribution, respectively. Furthermore, it has a great degree of dimension. In order to understand cognitive processes in the brain. It is vital for us to map out the flow of information in the brian. Or, to put it another way, we should attempt to assess functional connectivity in the brain.
